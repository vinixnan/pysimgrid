  """
  Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) scheduler.

  Many advantages of this method include:

  * pretty high performance
  * low time complexity (N**2M)
  * quite simple implementation

  The general idea is very simple:

  1. Sort tasks according in decreasing ranku order

     ranku(task) = ECT(task) + max_among_children(ranku(child) + ECOMT(task, child))

     where ECT and ECOMT are evaluated using platform mean speed, bandwidt and latency values

     Important property of this ordering is that it is also an topological order (see below).

  2. Go over ordered tasks list and schedule each one to the minimize task completion time.

     To estimate task completion time, ofc, you need to all task parents to be scheduled already.
     This is achieved automatically as HEFT order is also a topological sort for a tasks.

     HEFT scheduling allows insertions to happen, so if some host has an empty and wide enough time slot,
     next task may be added in between already scheduled tasks.

  For more details please refer to the original HEFT publication:
